                    Growing up, I’ve always had an inclination for arts. My dream futures as a child had always been shifting; it was a quickly changing process of conforming my visions to new knowledge I had been picking up along the way. There was a time, and I distinctly
                    remember it as my first, that I had dreamed of becoming an astronaut. In the small room that served as a house for a family of four, there was a science chart that hung just at the exact height I was at the time. The chart was one
                    that had etchings of the planets and the moon and the stars. I remember being so fascinated that I had proclaimed becoming an astronaut when I grow up. Later on, the astronaut dream was replaced by president, scientist, engineer, chef
                    and everything else that a child could dream of.

                    <p>
                        Somewhere along the way, I knew I had an affinity with drawing. It was something that made me happy and engaged. I liked the feeling of being able to create something. Subsequently, I knew I wanted to make a future out of it. In retrospect, this thought
                        was something that remained in the back of my mind. Pragmatically speaking, I was aware of the limitations that I presented. I knew what I can do and I knew what was impossible. Therefore, art was not a part of the feasible futures
                        I thought I could have.
                    </p>

                <div class="p_container">
                    <p>
                        Still, art remained as a beloved past time for myself. More often than not, the realization that somebody is better than me remained as a major drive to push the extent of what I could create.

                        Later on I would realize that I was not having fun with the act of drawing anymore. I felt that I was not making the things that I liked anymore and that I was swimming in a style of art that is profoundly saturated and less appreciated. While I liked
                        the idea that I was making works that are “good”, I felt that I was having less freedom expressing my style with a way of drawing that attempts to resemble authenticity, than what I feel is my own.

                <div class="p_container">
                    <p>
                        I started to care less if I’m drawing unrealistically. People might say that I degraded into drawing cartoons. I just feel that it is where I feel expressed.

                        By this time, I had been branching out to different forms of creative expressions, as well. I have been making photo edits, flyers, posters or wallpapers. I have also started video editing and dipped my toes into directing. Right now, I feel happier and
                        content with what I create. I don’t care as much if my works right now are not what many would consider “amazing” because I value creative expression and freedom more than the clout that comes with it. Here are some of my other
                        works:
